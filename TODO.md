# Goals for 3.0

### Project
* ~~No cocoapods structure~~
* Better readme. Include description of how to add keys to info plist. Requesting camera access. How to use PHAsset

### Features
* Videos
* Live images
* When presenting album selection. Slide down from entire navigation bar
* Better camera capture. And don't save captured photos to library - or no camera capture at all..? Hmm

### Code
* Less subclassing
* Child view controllers
* Data source shouldn't handle selections
* Handle updates to photo library better
* No images - draw them in code. So I don't have to handle cocoapods Bundle shenanigans 
* ~~No xib/storyboards~~
* Don't handle camera access, user of this library should do that
